Different types learning of JavaScript

I've created this respository as a learning respository pureply for different types, of JavaScript I will be working with. Will be writing this respository on an weekly basis. 

Please note, depending on what books I have I may be writing in a lower version of JavaScript and not the latest ES2016. I will update overtime.
